# komlog

This project is not actively developed.

Komlog was an attempt to create an intelligent monitoring system, capable of identifying metrics from unformatted text. 

It used some ML algorithms to identify metrics. These algorithms were automatically trained from user feedback.

Eventually, I had to abandon the project due to lack of time, however, although there was still a lot to do, I am very proud of what I managed to do.
